As a result he made a very great contest and asked every one to come and take part.\n\nIn his contest he gave the contestants many different pairs of numbers. Each number is made from digits 0 or 1. The contestants should write a new number corresponding to the given pair of numbers. The rule is simple: The i-th digit of the answer is 1 if and only if the i-th digit of the two given numbers differ. In the other case the i-th digit of the answer is 0.\n\nShapur made many numbers and first tried his own speed. He saw that he can perform these operations on numbers of length ∞ (length of a number is number of digits in it) in a glance! He always gives correct answers so he expects the contestants to give correct answers, too.

On the way home, she decided to draw n squares in the snow with a side length of 1. For simplicity, we assume that Sofia lives on a plane and can draw only segments of length 1, parallel to the coordinate axes, with vertices at integer points.\n\nIn order to draw a segment, Sofia proceeds as follows. If she wants to draw a vertical segment with the coordinates of the ends (x, y) and (x, y+1). Then Sofia looks if there is already a drawn segment with the coordinates of the ends (x', y) and (x', y+1) for some x'. If such a segment exists, then Sofia quickly draws a new segment, using the old one as a guideline. If there is no such segment, then Sofia has to take a ruler and measure a new segment for a long time. Same thing happens when Sofia wants to draw a horizontal segment, but only now she checks for the existence of a segment with the same coordinates x, x+1 and the differing coordinate y.\n\nFor example, if Sofia needs to draw one square, she will have to draw two segments using a ruler: \n\n<image>\n\nAfter that, she can draw the remaining two segments, using the first two as a guide: \n\n<image>\n\nIf Sofia needs to draw two squares, she will have to draw three segments using a ruler: \n\n<image>\n\nAfter that, she can draw the remaining four segments, using the first three as a guide: \n\n<image>\n\nSofia is in a hurry, so she wants to minimize the number of segments that she will have to draw with a ruler without a guide.
